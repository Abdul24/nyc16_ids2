4/19: [Introduction to Python and Version Control](#class-1-introduction-to-python-and-version-control) | 4/21: [Introduction to Linear Algebra and Statistics in Python](#class-2-introduction-to-linear-algebra-and-statistics-in-python)


### Before the Course Begins (Prework):
* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads).
* Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    * It is not necessary to download "GitHub for Windows" or "GitHub for Mac"
* Install [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) and sign into your github account through it.
* Install [slack](https://slack.com) and get the necessary credentials to communicate on the metis slack channels.
* Install the [Anaconda distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Python 2.7x.
    * If you choose not to use Anaconda, here is a list of the [Python packages](utils/python_packages.md) you will need to install prior to starting the course.
* Complete exercises 1-7, 13, 18-21, 27-35, 38, 39 of [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
* Watch the [linear algebra review videos](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005/lecture/preview) from Andrew Ng’s excellent Coursera ML course. They are labeled III. Linear Algebra Review (Week 1).
* Complete the exercises in chapters 2 and 3 of [this open textbook](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php).
)
* Practice Python using the resources below if you get through everything else.
* I would like to check the setup of your laptop before the course begins:
    * We need to figure out the logistics behind this, but it absolutely must happen before the course starts. If I cannot check it, someone else at Metis will, who will then sign off on you being able to start the course. YOU CANNOT START THE COURSE UNTIL EITHER I OR SOMEONE ELSE AT METIS CONFIRMS YOU HAVE A WORKING DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT.

### Python Resources
* [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): Good beginner material, including tons of in-browser exercises.
* [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/): Similar interface to Codecademy, but focused on teaching Python in the context of data science.
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/): Slightly more advanced, including hours of useful lecture videos and downloadable exercises (with solutions).
* [A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.
* [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php): A very beginner-oriented book, with associated [slides](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7X1ycQalUnyal9yeUx3VW81VDg&usp=sharing) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj4JXIwMwN1_ss1Tk8wZShEJ).
* [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/): Allows you to visualize the execution of Python code.

### Class 1: Introduction to Python and Version Control
* Welcome
* Briefly discuss the [course project](project/README.md) and [public data sources](project/public_data.md)
* Intro to [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
* Intro to IPython Notebooks ([notebook](notebooks/01_intro_to_ipython_notebook.ipynb))
* Intro to Python ([notebook](notebooks/01_intro_to_python.ipynb))
* Wrap up: Getting help, course schedule, office hours

**Homework:**
* Finish whatever exercises from [LPTHW](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) you couldn't finish. I assigned a lot of exercises as prework, so I suspect you have some things to work on. Focus on those concepts in the lecture that you didn't quite get.
* If your laptop has any setup issues, please work with me or someone else at Metis to resolve them by Thursday.

**Git Resources (IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE SOURCETREE):**
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is an excellent book for learning Git if you don't want to use SourceTree. Read the first two chapters if you want to gain a deeper understanding of version control.
* If you want to really practice a lot of Git (and learn many more commands), try [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/).
* [GitRef](http://gitref.org/) is an excellent reference guide for Git commands.

### Class 2: Introduction to Linear Algebra and Statistics in Python
* Introduction to Linear Algebra in Python ([notebook](notebooks/02_intro_numpy_linear_algebra.ipynb))
* Introduction to Statistics in Python ([notebook](notebooks/02_intro_scipy_statistics.ipynb))

**Homework:**
* Work through as much of the [NumPy quickstart guide](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html) as you can.
* Work through as much of the [SciPy statistics tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html) as you can.
* Work through the remainder of the statistics exercises in the prework.
